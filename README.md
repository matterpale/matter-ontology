# Matter Ontology

An attempt at designing a reusable upper ontology.

The original endeavor was a by-product of a thesis work that dealt with utilization of OWL and other semantic web standards for purposes of flexible industry production. The limitations of OWL ontologies led to experiments with other kinds of semantically oriented technology and eventually to this project.

The [owl](https://github.com/matterpale/matter-ontology/tree/main/owl) directory contains the original design with a use-case example while the [vaticle](https://github.com/matterpale/matter-ontology/tree/main/vaticle) directory contains its translation to Vaticle TypeDB with further remarks and some more examples.
